Non-production assets.
Used for debugging, experiments, references, and temporary exports.

DO NOT import from here in production code.
Safe to delete contents at any time.

## Structure
- **debug/**: Camera dumps, scene states, and render debug passes.
- **reference/**: Competitor UIs, lighting examples, and easing refs.
- **experiments/**: Shader playgrounds, test materials, and half-baked ideas.
- **exports/**: Local QA outputs (GIFs, snapshots) for comparison.

This saves future-you from confusion.
